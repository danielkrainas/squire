# Squire

Squire is my personal framework I use in many of my projects. It contains many advanced utilities, predefined common classes (address, contact info, etc), and extensions. It's entire point is to get me up and running faster.

This isn't your typical "core framework/library" I've worked hard to ensure it is supporting, unrestrictive, and easy to use. Some of the key concepts embedded within it are _domain-driven design_, _aspect-orientated programming_, and what I'm going to coin _game-orientated design_.
